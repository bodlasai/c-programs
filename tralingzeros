The problem is as follows.
Given a number, you should tell how many trailing zeros are present in the factorial of that number.



#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int n,c,i,t=0;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    c=5;
    while((n/c)>=1)
    {
        t=t+n/c;
        c=c*5;
    }
    printf("%d",t);
    return 0;
}
